The code implements a Queue data structure using a linked list. The Queue class is a template class, allowing it to work with any data type. It includes the following functionalities:

push(const T& value): Adds a new element to the rear of the queue.
pop(): Removes the element from the front of the queue.
front() const: Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
size() const: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
empty() const: Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
move_to_rear(): Moves the element at the front of the queue to the rear, making the element that was second in line the new front element.
display() const: Displays all the elements in the queue.
The main function demonstrates the usage of the Queue class by creating a queue of integers, pushing 10 values into it, displaying the elements in the queue, and then moving the front element to the rear.

Overall, the code provides a flexible and efficient implementation of the Queue data structure, allowing for easy manipulation of elements in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.
